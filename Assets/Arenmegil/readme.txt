This is one of my first tries to make 3d model with Physical Based Shader techniques. I'm a programmer not an artist, but I would like to improve my skills in this field too. I really would like to read your feedback, so please tell me your thoughts about this piece of work of mine on the reviews board in the assetstore! 
Thank you!
