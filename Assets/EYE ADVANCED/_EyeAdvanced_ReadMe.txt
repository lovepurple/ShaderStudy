INSTALLATION
-------------
NOTE: Eye Advanced versions 1.0.2+ Requires Unity 5.0 or greater.

I. IMPORT EYEADVANCED BASE FILES INTO YOUR PROJECT

Go to: "Assets -> Import Package -> Custom Package..." in the Unity Menu. Then select the
"EyeAdvanced_v1.x.unitypackage" file.  This will open an import dialog box.
Click the import button and all the EyeAdvanced files will be imported into your project list.

A Note about Demo Content... The EyeAdvanced installer file contains a basic demo setup scene.  If you don’t need this scene in your project, you can disable importing the demo content by unchecking the EYE ADVANCED/_DEMO folder in the import dialog window before importing.


II. ADD THE EYEADVANCE PREFAB TO YOUR SCENE

1) drag one of the "EyeAdvanced" prefabs located in the "/PREFABS" folder into your scene list.

EyeAdvanced_0 - High Resolution Eye prefab with advanced shader effects.
EyeAdvanced_1 - Medium Resolution Eye prefab with simplified shader effects.
EyeAdvanced_2 - Low Resolution Eye prefab with simplified shader effects.
EyeAdvanced_LOD - Automatically changes LOD from high to low based on distance.
